## Importing Existing Documentation

Don't start from scratch - import your existing documentation to get up and running faster.

<CodeGroup tabs="Markdown,Confluence,GitHub">
  ```bash
# Import Markdown files
evo import --source ./docs --format markdown --space "My Project"
  ```
  ```bash
# Import from Confluence
evo import --source https://company.atlassian.net/wiki --space "Company Wiki" --token $CONFLUENCE_TOKEN
  ```
  ```bash
# Import from GitHub repository
evo import --source https://github.com/company/repo --path docs/ --space "API Docs"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices for Setup

- **Organize by Project**: Create separate spaces for different projects or products to maintain clear boundaries.
- **Set Clear Permissions**: Define roles and permissions early to prevent access issues as your team grows.
- **Use Templates**: Leverage EVO's built-in templates for common documentation types like API references and user guides.
- **Enable Version Control**: Turn on versioning to track changes and maintain a history of your documentation.
- **Schedule Reviews**: Set up regular review cycles to keep documentation current and accurate.
